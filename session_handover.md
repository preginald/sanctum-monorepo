## 0. SESSION HANDOVER: Portal Link Neutralization

### Current Status
- **Goal:** Neutralize article links inside the "Portal" view. Specifically, the headers generated by `sanctum-core/app/services/content_engine.py` (which uses a `[article:slug]` shortcode) should not be clickable `<a>` tags when viewed in the ticket portal, as they currently lead to the public `/wiki/` path and break the user's session.
- **Frontend File:** `sanctum-web/src/pages/PortalTicketDetail.jsx`
- **Rendering Component:** `sanctum-web/src/components/ui/SanctumMarkdown.jsx` (Uses `react-markdown` and `rehype-raw`).
- **Backend File:** `sanctum-core/app/services/content_engine.py` renders the raw HTML string: 
  `<a href="/wiki/{slug}" class="ds-portal-link">...</a>`

### The Issue
Attempts to fix this in the Python backend caused syntax errors. Attempts to fix this in the React `a` mapper within `SanctumMarkdown.jsx` by checking `props.className` have so far failed to render the links as static spans.

### Technical Debt / Notes
- The Python engine has been restored to its original state (valid syntax).
- A CSS "hack" exists in `PortalTicketDetail.jsx` (`.ds-portal-link { pointer-events: none }`), but it is currently ineffective, possibly due to specificity or the way `SanctumMarkdown` handles raw HTML via `rehype-raw`.
- **Recommendation:** Either use a regex in the `SanctumMarkdown` component to strip the `href` attribute from strings containing `ds-portal-link` before rendering, or refine the `rehype` processing to handle these specific elements.
